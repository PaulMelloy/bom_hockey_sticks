Identifying weather stations that show dramatic weather change in the last decade

A good example of this is Cape Moreton lighthouse. 
The temperature records go back over 110 years, and temperature extremes are buffered by ocean temperatures.

Feel free to fork and add other interesting weather stations showing signs of climate change.
