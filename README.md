The temperature records go back over 110 years, and temperature extremes are buffered by ocean temperatures.

Feel free to fork and add other interesting weather stations showing signs of climate change or add to the discussion by adding an [issue](https://github.com/PaulMelloy/bom_hockey_sticks/issues).
